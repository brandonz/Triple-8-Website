Besides being in Triple 8, she's also involved with Chinese Students Association, Sustainable Software Initiative, and Princeton Women in Computer Science. Mayee is secretly (or not-so-secretly) a huge Kpop fangirl who likes to consume obscene quantities of sugar, do math, and identify tree species in her free time. She also has an irrational fear of mushrooms so please do not throw any at her if you see her on campus. Even though she's still struggling with her thug/angst/emotional face and pointing her toes, she's excited to be dancing on stage instead of in front of her bedroom mirror and is proud to call Triple 8 her best family at Princeton. <3",
